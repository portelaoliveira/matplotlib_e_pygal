# GENERATING DATA

Data visualization involves the exploration of data through visual representations. It is closely related to data mining, which uses code to explore patterns and connections in a data set. A data set can be just a short list of numbers that fits in one line of code, or it can be many gigabytes of data.

## THE MATPLOTLIB GALLERY

We will generate graphs using matplotlib and then customize it to create a more informative view of our data.
with matplotlib it was done:

* Simple line graph;
* Changes to the label type and chart thickness;
* Plot and style individual points with scatter;
* Plot a series of points with scatter;
* Calculate data automatically;
* Remove outlines from data points;
* Define custom colors;
* Use a colormap;
* Automatically save your graphics;

### Random walks;

* Create the RandomWalk class;
* Choose directions;
* Plot the random walk;
* Generate multiple random tours;
* Style the tour;
* Color the dots;
* Plot the start and end points;
* Limpando os eixos;
* Add points for plotting;
* Change the size to fill the screen;

## Rolling dice with Pygal;

The Pygal Python visualization package was used to produce files with scalable vector graphics. They are useful in visualizations presented on screens of different sizes, as they are automatically scaled to suit the viewer's screen. If you plan to use your visualizations online, consider using Pygal to make your work look good on any device people use for visualizations.
In the project we will analyze the results of the data entry. If you roll a six-sided dice, you have the same chance of getting any number from 1 to 6. However, when using two dice, you are more likely to take certain numbers and not others. We will try to determine which numbers are most likely to occur by generating a data set that represents the data roll. Then we will plot the result of a larger number of launches to determine which results are more likely than others.

### PYGAL GALLERY
Steps made in the project:

* Creating the Die class;
* Rolling the dice;
* Analyzing the results;
* Creating a histogram;
* Rolling two dice;
* Rolling dice of different sizes;
